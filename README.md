# keyfloat
LaTeX keyfloat package — key/value float creation

Quickly set and dynamically rearrange floats, subfloats, and rows of floats.

This package is especially useful for anyone who has to place and re-arrange large numbers of figures, tables, and image floats. Easy syntax. Float layout changes dynamically as new floats are added to a group.

The keyﬂoat package provides a key/value user interface for quickly creating figures with a single image each, figures with arbitrary contents, tables, subfloats, rows of floats, floats located [H]ere, floats in the [M]argin, and floats with text [W]rapped around them.

Key/value combinations may specify a caption and label, a width proportional to \linewidth, a fixed width and/or height, rotation, scaling, a tight or loose frame, an \arraystretch, a continued float, additional supplemental text, and an artist/author’s name with automatic index entry. When used with the tocdata
package, the name also appears in the List of Figures.

Floats may be moved into or rearranged inside a multi-row environment or subfloats, and are typeset to fit within the given number of columns, continuing to additional rows as necessary. Nested sub-rows may be used to generate layouts such as two small figures placed vertically next to one larger figure.
